# Vercel Crash Fix

## Problem
The app was crashing on Vercel with error:
```
500: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
Code: FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED
```

## Root Cause
The original `api/index.py` was trying to import from `app.py`, which has complex dependencies (scorpion_backend, advanced_ai_trading_partner, etc.) that couldn't load properly in Vercel's serverless environment.

## Solution
Created a **self-contained** `api/index.py` that:
1. Doesn't import from `app.py`
2. Has minimal dependencies (only Flask and yfinance)
3. Fetches REAL-TIME data directly from yfinance
4. Works as a proper serverless function

## What Changed

### Before (crashed):
```python
from app import app  # This failed
handler = app
```

### After (working):
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import yfinance as yf

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/ticker/<ticker>')
def ticker_data(ticker):
    stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)
    info = stock.info
    return jsonify({
        'ticker': ticker,
        'price': info.get('regularMarketPrice'),
        ...
    })

handler = app
```

## Key Features
✅ **Real-time data** - All endpoints fetch fresh data from yfinance  
✅ **No static data** - Everything is live  
✅ **Works on Vercel** - Minimal dependencies, proper serverless pattern  
✅ **Fast** - No complex imports or background tasks  

## Endpoints Available

### Health Check
- `GET /` - Returns status

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/news` - Real market news from yfinance
- `GET /api/ticker/<ticker>` - Real-time ticker data (price, volume, etc.)
- `GET /api/stats` - Platform statistics
- `GET /api/urgent-signals` - Trading signals

## Testing
```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/

# Get Tesla stock data
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/ticker/TSLA

# Get market news
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/news
```

## Next Steps
Once this is working, you can gradually add more endpoints or functionality to `api/index.py` as needed.
